LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Project

The content created and shared was produced as part of a bachelor’s degree final year project in mechanical engineering. 
I am a student at The University of Sheffield and used the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 kit to produce an interactive experience, to raise awareness of the participation gap within mechanical engineering and encourage women to consider it as a career path. The experience was used to also show the accessibility of design and mechanical engineering. 

The identified target audience was young girls, aged 14-16 in secondary schools, as this is where the first stage of the pipeline effect was identified as occurring. This is where the pool of selection of people for engineering decreases due to subject choices between education levels, hence the ‘pipeline’.

The experience itself was developed to be a demonstration of a current ethical scenario within mechanical engineering- the trolley problem. 
The trolley problem is an ethical problem, whereby a runaway train carriage is heading towards a group of five people on its tracks, with no way of them hearing the approaching carriage, or the carriage stopping. However, one passer-by has the option to change the course of the carriage so that it is diverted onto an additional piece of track. Doing this however means the death of one person, but the passer by will have to live with the consequences of their actions. 
Due to the potential of this scenario becoming emotionally harming, for example using people as examples, the scenario was such that the carriage would be designed as a car, and the ‘people’ would instead be farm animals that coincidentally happened to be in a road, but with nowhere to go. 
The experience was tested with the target audience at a ‘STEM for Girls’ event hosted by the University. The feedback was positive, and the materials used have been published for further feedback and to continue the outreach to the audience, via teachers within schools.
